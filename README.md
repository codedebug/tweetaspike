Tweetaspike
===========

This application is built using -- Aerospike + Express + Angular + Node -- ASEAN (/a-shawn/) Stack.

The purpose of this sample application is to show that Aerospike data structures on top of a key-value store are an effective way to write applications with Aerospike as the only database. To demonstrate, this sample describes the design and implementation of a twitter-like application. 

The code is easy to follow and substantial enough to be a foundation in learning how to leverage Aerospike's technology and it can also be used as a "seed" application that you can expand.

### Get Up and Running

#### Prerequisite

- [Aerospike Server](http://www.aerospike.com/download/server/latest) â€“ The server should be running and accessible from this app.

#### Usage

##### Build

To build the application and resolve dependencies, run command: **npm install**

##### Config

In [aerospike_config.js](https://github.com/aerospike/tweetaspike/blob/master/lib/controllers/aerospike_config.js), update **aerospikeCluster** and **aerospikeClusterPort** such that it points to your instance running Aerospike Server.

##### Run

To run the application, run command: **node server**

You should see message **Connection to Aerospike cluster succeeded!**

If you see *Connection to Aerospike cluster failed!*, please make sure your instance of Aerospike Server is running and available. Also confirm that **aerospikeCluster** and **aerospikeClusterPort** are set correctly as described above in the Config section.

If all is well, open web browser and point it to: [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)
