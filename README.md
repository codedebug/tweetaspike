Tweetaspike
===========

This application is built using ASEAN (/a-shawn/) Stack - Aerospike + Express + Angular + Node.

The purpose of this sample application is to show that Aerospike data structures on top of a key-value store are an effective way to write applications with Aerospike as the only database. To demonstrate, this sample describes the design and implementation of a twitter-like application. The code is easy to follow and substantial enough to be a foundation in learning how to leverage Aerospike's technology and it can also be used as a "seed" application that you can expand.

# Next Step -- Get up and running

## Prerequisite

- [Aerospike Server](http://www.aerospike.com/download/server/latest) â€“ The server should be running and accessible from this app.

## Usage

### Build

To build the application:

**npm install**

This will resolve all dependencies.

### Config

In [aerospike_config.js](https://github.com/aerospike/tweetaspike/blob/master/lib/controllers/aerospike_config.js), update **aerospikeCluster** and **aerospikeClusterPort** such that it points to your server running Aerospike Server.

### Run

To run the application:

**node server**

You should see message **Connection to Aerospike cluster succeeded!**. If not, please make sure your Aerospike Server is running and available. Also confirm that **aerospikeCluster** and **aerospikeClusterPort** are set correctly.

If all is well, open web browser to:

  [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)
